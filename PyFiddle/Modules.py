# import a module
import random

# access function / value in a module - i.e. moduleName.var
value = random.randint(0,3)
print(value)

# import only one function / value from module
# import the pi value from the math module - note how we can access the pi variable directly:
from math import pi
print(pi)

# We can import all objects in a module like this:
# 
# from math import *
#
# However, our variables can be confused with those from the module
# Therefore, this is bad practice

# importing multiple objects from a package
from math import sqrt, cos, pi
print("square root of 4: " + str(int(sqrt(4))))
print("cos 90 should equal 0: " + str(cos(pi/2)))
print("Well, Python was pretty close...bit of a rounding error there..!")

# We can change the name of imported objects by doing the following
from math import sin as sine
print("sin(90) should be 1: " + str(int(sine(pi/2))))
  
# useful modules from the Python standard library:    
# string, re, datetime, math, random, os, multiprocessing, subprocess, socket, email, json, doctest, unittest, pdb, argparse and sys.

# Pip can be used to install 3rd party libraries from the command prompt. These are from the Python Package Index (PyPI). pip must be installed - often packaged with IDEs
# Use pip install library_name
